Overall Technical Architecture for InterEd Recruitment Platform
System Overview
The InterEd Student Recruitment Platform will be built as a comprehensive web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with three distinct portals:
1.	Student Portal: For prospective and current students to manage their application journey
2.	Agent Portal: For recruitment partners and sub-agents to manage their student referrals
3.	Admin Portal: For InterEd staff to manage all aspects of the recruitment process

•	API Rate Limiting: Protection against abuse
•	Data Encryption: Both at rest and in transit
•	GDPR Compliance Measures: For handling EU student data
•	Regular Security Audits: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
•	Two-Factor Authentication: For sensitive operations
Database Design
![Database Schema]
•	Collections/Tables: 
o	Users (Students, Agents, Staff)
o	Universities and Programs
o	Applications
o	Documents
o	Payments
o	Communications
o	Tasks and Reminders
o	Reports and Analytics
o	Feedback and Surveys
API Design
•	RESTful API Endpoints: 
o	/api/auth/*: Authentication and authorization
o	/api/students/*: Student management
o	/api/agents/*: Agent management
o	/api/applications/*: Application processing
o	/api/universities/*: University and program management
o	/api/documents/*: Document management
o	/api/communications/*: Messaging and notifications
o	/api/reports/*: Analytics and reporting
o	/api/payments/*: Financial transactions
Microservices (Optional for Future Scaling)
For larger scale deployments, the system could be broken into microservices:
•	Authentication Service
•	Student Management Service
•	Agent Management Service
•	Application Processing Service
•	Document Management Service
•	Communication Service
•	Analytics and Reporting Service
•	Payment Processing Service
Scalability and Performance Considerations
•	Horizontal Scaling: Adding more application servers during peak periods
•	Database Sharding: For handling large data volumes
•	CDN Integration: For faster global content delivery
•	Lazy Loading: For optimized resource delivery
•	Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Option for improved initial load performance
•	Caching Strategy: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data
Compliance and Localization
•	GDPR Compliance: For handling European student data
•	Multi-language Support: Internationalization for global reach
•	Regional Data Storage: To comply with data sovereignty laws
•	Accessibility Standards: WCAG compliance
Disaster Recovery and Backup
•	Automated Backups: Regular database and file backups
•	Multi-region Deployment: For high availability
•	Failover Systems: For minimal downtime
•	Data Retention Policies: Compliant with industry standards
This comprehensive architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, secure, and feature-rich international student recruitment platform that can evolve with InterEd's growing business needs.
